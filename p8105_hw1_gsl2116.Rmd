```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

## Problem 1

Create a data frame comprised of:  
+ A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution  
+ A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2  
+ A (length-10) character vector  
+ A (length-10) factor vector  

```{r p1_data}
set_a = tibble(
  samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logic = is.logical(samp > 2),
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(vec_char)
 )

mean(samp)
```
