Problem 1
---------

Create a data frame comprised of:
+ A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
+ A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
+ A (length-10) character vector
+ A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1)
set_a = tibble(
  samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logic = is.logical(samp > 2),
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(vec_char)
 )
```

``` r
as.numeric(set_a$vec_logic)
as.numeric(set_a$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(set_a$vec_factor)
```

Problem 2
---------

Create a data frame comprised of:
+ x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
+ y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
+ A logical vector indicating whether the x + y &gt; 0
+ A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
+ A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

``` r
set.seed(1)
plot_data = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  logical_plot = is.logical(x + y > 0),
  factor_plot = factor(logical_plot)
)
```

This dataset has 1000 observations. The mean of x is -0.0116481, and the median of x is \`r median(plot\_data$x). The proportion of cases for which the logical vector is TRUE.
