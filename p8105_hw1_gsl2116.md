Problem 1
---------

Create a data frame comprised of:
+ A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
+ A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
+ A (length-10) character vector
+ A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set_a = tibble(
  samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logic = is.logical(samp > 2),
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(vec_char)
 )
```
